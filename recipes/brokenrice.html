    <h2> Broken Rice (Com Tam) is a popular type of white rice served with many Vietnamese dishes. You often see it in rice plates featuring a combination of grilled meats, egg meatloaf, salad and pickles.</h2>

        <li>Grilled meats</li>
        <li>Pickled daikon and carrots or other pickled vegetables</li>

        <li>Chả Trứng — A Vietnamese steamed egg and pork meatloaf.</li>
        <li>Fried sunny side egg — Because eggs in the egg and pork meatloaf are not enough.</li>

        <li>Bì Heo — Cooked thinly sliced pork and pork skin tossed in a mixture of roasted rice powder and garlic.</li>
        <li>Nước Chấm — The mother sauce of Vietnam, a sweet, sour, and savory sauce served on the side. Pour the sauce all over the rice plate to bring everything together.</li>
